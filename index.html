			<p>
				Hi, I'm a <b>Software Engineer</b> with 15 years of experience
				in the industry, an <b>Author</b>, and an <b>Eagle Scout</b>.
			</p>
			<p>
				My goal is to improve peopleâ€™s lives by developing products and
				processes that empower them to be more effective and efficient.
				I strive to collaborate with end users to ensure that the things
				we create: help instead of hinder; save time instead of
				<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX0ItVEVjHc&t=4682s"
					>wasting</a

				<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De0Am_QcZiQ&t=163s"
					>it</a
				>; and most importantly, that they meet both the technical
				requirements <i>and</i> people's
				<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whM_ERuccUs&t=780s">
					needs</a
				>. To that end, I have done full stack work primarily focused on
				the frontend and automation. Below, are some of the types of
				projects that I've done in the past.

				Due to confidentiality agreements, I cannot discuss most of my
				work, but I will do my best to give a general overview
				nonetheless. One of my earliest projects faced significant
				memory constraints on both clients and server. In order to
				circumvent those limitations, I used lessons from game
				development to distribute hi-res image processing across clients
				before sending data off to the server for caching. From there, I
				sought out opportunities to get my colleagues to delegate their
				most tedious tasks to me so that I could automate them away. As
				time went on, I got the opportunity to create more full stack
				applications from scratch (using various frameworks, databases,
				and cloud services).
			</p>
			<p>
				Over the years, I have continued to work my way through the
				entire stack, starting from the frontend, going through the
				backend, and even venturing into automated deployments.
				Personally, I have found TypeScript to be invaluable throughout
				this process (in order to help maintain large-scale JavaScript
				codebases) and have enjoyed the ability to reuse code between
				client and server when developing Node.js and Electron
				applications. On a non-technical level, I frequently use mind
				maps to break down large projects and visualize their
				dependencies. I even wrote a prototype called Flow to help
				digitize this process and dust off my old trigonometry and
				collision detection skills.

			<p>
				Most of my web work has been done through consulting and the
				projects showcased here are no exception. In both cases, I was
				called in to work on existing code. In the case of the Chrome
				Extension,
				<a
					href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/smart-screen/dljhjjnhapclmfbagbdkkpfkjgpkkfho"
					>Smart Screen</a
				>, I was tasked with updating the layout using my knowledge of
				CSS (which is showcased throughout this entire page as the
				decorative devices surrounding every screenshot are entirely
				made up of vanilla CSS). In terms of the
				<a href="https://www.fpa-foundation.org/"
					>FPA Foundation website</a
				>, I made accessibility and User Experience (UX) tweaks in
				addition to content edits.
			</p>
			<p>
				Aside from the aforementioned projects, I enjoy working on
				multilingual sites and relish any opportunity to put my interest
				in Human Computer Interaction (HCI) to use in order to improve
				UX (e.g., subtly subitizing table rows so that the human eye can
				more easily distinguish between items on a subconscious level,
				or adding in multi-column sort/filter functionality). When page
				performance becomes an issue, I ruthlessly cull div soup and
				unnecessary JavaScript until the problem is solved (often times
				using the critically underutilized option that is CSS in their
				stead).

				Like many in the industry, I initially set out to learn
				programming in order to make video games, but I quickly fell in
				love with making productivity tools. However, before I switched
				my focus, I managed to make countless prototypes and actually
				finish four games. Using techniques outlined in Stanford's
				<i>Developing Mobile Apps with Web Technologies</i>
				<a
					href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/itunes-u/developing-mobile-apps-web/id384233308"
					>course</a
				>
				on iTunesU, I was able to create cross-platform applications
				across a variety of desktop and mobile operating systems to
				achieve every developer's dream of "write once, run anywhere".
			</p>
			<p>
				The two most successful of these projects were Eternal Champions
				and Bloque It. The first was a brief game about learning
				financial literacy and ethics from Norse deities (furthermore,
				it is an "award-winning" RPG in the most technical sense of the
				term due to it having won 1<sup>st</sup> place in a state-level
				competition). Meanwhile, Bloque It was released on multiple app
				stores (i.e., iOS and
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox_OS">FirefoxOS</a
				>). It taught me many lessons that I still use to this day
				(e.g., how to optimize code to run smoothly on low budget
				hardware and how to deploy global updates that gracefully
				convert application data to new schemas).

				In accordance with the ABCs of Writing (Accuracy, Brevity, and
				Clarity)--not to mention contractual obligations--I have omitted
				many other projects, such as volunteer and/or ongoing AI-related
				ones. But since many of those would retread familiar ground
				and/or be premature, I'll briefly mention the lessons learned on
				one of my more eclectic endeavors: becoming an <em>author</em>.
				Throughout my quest, I learned that ePub files contain XHTML.
				But sadly, using HTML and CSS is less straightforward than it
				would first appear...
			</p>
			<p>
				Unfortunately, eBook readers are nearly as antiquated as most
				publishers' websites. Navigating the latter is often an exercise
				in archeology while the former <i>still</i> don't support CSS3
				after all this time. To complicate matters further, browser
				vendors have only
				<a
					href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/new-in-chrome-131#page"
					>recently</a
				>
				begun to implement parts of the CSS Paged Media Spec.
				Fortunately,
				<a href="https://pagedjs.org/">paged.js</a> provides a polyfill
				and an invaluable print preview feature, which makes it possible
				to generate print-ready PDFs for physical editions. If you'd
				like more details on that process, or anything else mentioned
				throughout this page, please do not hesitate to
