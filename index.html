			<p>
				Hi, I'm a <b>Software Engineer</b> with 15 years of experience
				in the industry, an <b>Author</b>, and an <b>Eagle Scout</b>.
			</p>
			<p>
				My goal is to improve peopleâ€™s lives by developing products and
				processes that empower them to be more effective and efficient.
				As such, I strive to collaborate with end users to ensure that
				the things we create: help instead of hinder; don't
				<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX0ItVEVjHc&t=4682s"
					>waste</a
				>
				<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De0Am_QcZiQ&t=163s"
					>time</a
				>; and most importantly, that they meet both technical
				requirements <i>and</i> people's
				<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whM_ERuccUs&t=780s">
					needs</a
				>. In service of this goal, I have done full stack work
				primarily focused on the frontend and automation. Below, are
				some of types of projects that I've done in the past.

			<p>
				Throughout my career, I've primarily worked on internal tooling.
				As such, I cannot discuss many of the details, but I will do my
				best to give a general overview nonetheless. I started out
				writing an image search application which faced significant
				memory constraints on both client and server-side devices. In
				order to circumvent those challenges, I used lessons from game
				development to distribute hi-res image processing across clients
				before sending data off to the server for caching. From there, I
				sought out opportunities to get my colleagues to delegate their
				most tedious tasks to me so that I could automate them away. As
				time went on, I got the opportunity to create more full stack
				applications from scratch which utilized various frameworks,
				databases, and cloud services.
			</p>
			<p>
				Over the years, I have continued to work my way through the
				entire stack, starting from the front end and venturing into
				automated deployments. Personally, I have found TypeScript to be
				invaluable throughout this process (in order to help maintain
				large-scale JavaScript codebases) and have enjoyed the ability
				to reuse code between client and server when developing Node.js
				and Electron applications. On a non-technical level, I
				frequently use mind maps to break down large projects and
				visualize their dependencies. I even wrote a prototype called
				Flow to help digitize this process and dust off my old
				trigonometry and collision detection skills.

			<p>
				Most of my web work has been done through consulting and the
				projects showcased here are no exception. In both of these
				instances, I was called in to make updates to existing code. In
				the case of the Chrome Extension,
				<a
					href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/smart-screen/dljhjjnhapclmfbagbdkkpfkjgpkkfho"
					>Smart Screen</a
				>
				(on the left), I was tasked with updating the layout due to my
				familiarity with CSS (which is showcased throughout this entire
				page as the decorative device surrounding every screenshot is
				entirely made up of vanilla CSS and pseudo elements). In terms
				of the
				<a href="https://www.fpa-foundation.org/"
					>FPA Foundation website</a
				>, I made accessibility and User Experience (UX) tweaks in
				addition to content edits.
			</p>
			<p>
				Given the range of clients, I've worked with various Content
				Management Systems (CMS) and Static Site Generators (SSG). In
				order to improve page performance, I ruthlessly cull div soup
				and unnecessary JavaScript whenever performance problems arise.
				In addition to the aforementioned work, I personally enjoy
				working on multilingual sites and relish any opportunity to put
				my interest in Human Computer Interaction (HCI) to use in order
				to improve UX (e.g., subitizing table rows so that the human eye
				can more easily distinguish between items on a subconscious
				level, or adding in multi-column sort/filter functionality).
